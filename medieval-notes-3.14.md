## Moses Maimonides

- Guide for the Perplexed
    - God
        * God is incorporeal
        * God is utterly unlike anything in our experience
        * versus the "Attributists"
        * 5 ways to describe:
            1. define
            2. part of a definition
            3. quality (height, color, etc.)
            4. relatedness (to something else) --> even existence is different for God
            5. actions --> only one that can be taken literally
    - Reading scripture

# Reading Scripture
> Philosophy can help us know what in the Bible cannot be taken literally
> Plain sense of scripture must have primacy if:
    1. Its teaching is clear
    2. The philosophical arguments to the contrary are only probably, not demonstrated

# Creation
- 3 theories:
    1. Biblical creation
        - universe had a beginning, out of nothing
    2. Plato's view in Timaeus
        - current order had a beginning, but was made from pre-existing stuff
    3. Aristotle's view
        - universe is eternal
        - nature's laws never change



## The Latin-speaking world of medieval Europe

1. Revival of learning due to Charlemagne
2. Revival of learning beginning in 11th century
    - begins in monasteries -> new interest in {u}logic                                     (Lanfranc, vs. Berengar)
    - cathedral schools                                                                         V
    - individual "masters"                                                                   invoked substance/accidents
    - universities

# Anselm of Canterbury (or of Aosta) c. 1033-1109

- Proslogion (all of Christian teaching, trying to show the logic that ties it together)
  -> faith seeking understanding

- Argument about God's existence
    - Characterization of God: God is that than which nothing greater can be thought (T.T.W.N.G.C.B.T.)
    - premise: to exist in the mind and reality is greater than to exist in the mind only
    - T.T.W.N.G.C.B.T. exists in the mind
    - if T.T.W.N.G.C.B.T. exists in the mind only, it is not T.T.W.N.G.C.B.T.
    - therefore, T.T.W.N.G.C.B.T. exists in the mind and in reality
