    "## Introduction and background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore a particular model for the electrodynamics of an <b>excitable cell</b>, such as a neuron or cardiac cell. The hallmark feature of excitable cells is that they can support excitation pulses known as <b>action potential</b>, in which the electric potential (voltage) difference across the cellular membrane \"spikes\" under a mild stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"ap.png\" width = 500>\n",
    "Image: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential>Wikipedia</a>.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the voltage dynamics are <i>nonlinear</i>. The response of the cell is not proportional to the input. There exists a threshold such that sufficiently small stimuli do not result in an excitation pulse. Any stimuli above the threshold result in similar pulses. When cells are connected, the excitation pulse leads to a current which can excite nearby cells so that these action potential propagate through tissue (e.g., a signal causing your heart muscles to contract in such a way that blood is pushed through the chambers of the heart).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, these excitations cost energy. After an excitation, the cells need some time to return to a configuration in which they can fire again. This minimum resting time is known as a <b>refractory period</b>. Any additional electrical stimuli that occur during the refactory period (even those above threshold) will <b>not</b> result in additional excitation pulses. The refractory period of a particular cell can depend on many complicated factors, but it's possible that certain arrythmia or other conditions can arise when normal propagation requires the heart cells to fire during refractory periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple model for these types of cells is provided by the parallel ionic channel picture. The cell's lipid bilayer results in an effective capacitance. Ion pumps for particular species and channels that let specific ions flow result in nonlinear conductances for each type of ion considered. A typical picture models all of this complicated structure via a simple parallel circuit in which each type of ion has its own branch, gated by a (voltage-dependent, or nonlinear) conductance in addition to the capacitance of the cell membrane:\n",

    "\n",
    "The <b>Morris-Lecar (ML) model</b> is an example of a two-variable system which describes (qualitatively) the behavior of neurons or cardiac cells by incorporating dynamics in the calcium and potassium ionic channels as well as a leakage channel across the cell membrane. The equations are given as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C\\frac{dV}{dt} = I - g_{L}(V-V_{L})-g_{Ca}M_{ss}(V-V_{Ca})-g_{K}W(V-V_{K})$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{dW}{dt} = \\frac{W_{ss}-W}{\\tau_{W}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{ss} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\tanh\\left[\\frac{V-V_{1}}{V_{2}}\\right]\\right)$$\n",
    "$$W_{ss} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\tanh\\left[\\frac{V-V_{3}}{V_{4}}\\right]\\right)$$\n",
    "$$\\tau_{W} = \\frac{1}{\\varphi \\cosh\\left[\\frac{V-V_{3}}{2V_{4}}\\right]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that <b>hyperbolic trig functions</b> like $\\tanh(x)$, $\\cosh(x)$ are available via `np.tanh(x)`, `np.cosh(x)`. The dynamical variables are $V(t)$ (membrane potential) and $W(t)$ (\"recovery variable\" corresponding to the probability that the potassium ion channel is conducting). Parameters are\n",
    "\n",
    "- $I(t)$ - applied current (possibly time-dependent function)\n",
    "- $C$ - membrane capacitance\n",
    "- $g_{L}$, $g_{Ca}$, $g_{K}$ - conductances of leakage, calcium and potassium channels\n",
    "- $V_{L}$, $V_{Ca}$, $V_{K}$ - equilibrium potential for leakage, calcium, potassium channels\n",
    "- $V_{1}$, $V_{2}$, $V_{3}$, $V_{4}$ - tuning parameters\n",
    "- $\\varphi$ - overall frequency scale\n",
    "\n",
    "It is understandable to feel somewhat dizzy at the myriad of constants and formulas involved in this \"simple\" model. In the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model we considered as a previous example, the dynamics are simplified with all of the dimensional parameters lumped into a handful of pieces. That model is a sort of mathematical idealization that captures the essential ideas qualitatively. Toward the quantitative end, the Hodgkin-Huxley model consists of four dynamical variables and was derived empircally from careful experiments with [squid giant axons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Giant_Axon_of_Squid_%2814356033761%29.jpg) in the late 1940s/early 1950s (<i>not</i> to be confused with \"[giant squid](https://news.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/images/2020-01/Squid1380.jpg?itok=17LuiUfq)\" axons). Since that time, more complicated models involving additional channels have been developed (for example, the <i>eight</i>-variable [Beeler-Reuter](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Models_of_cardiac_cell#Beeler-Reuter_model_.281977.29_.5B8_variables.5D) model). The Morris-Lecar model sort of splits the difference: it's only a two-variable system, but the physiological parameters (with all the dimensions) are retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Remark: </b> These more complicated models (Hodgkin-Huxley/Beeler-Reuter/others?) would make for great projects if you're interested in exploring them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this project is to use RK4 to integrate the ML equations and obtain $V(t)$ in a variety of situations. To begin, here are the various parameters that I will package into a vector `param` to be used by the set of functions involved in this process. Units are omitted, but you can check at Wikipedia/Scholarpedia give the same values in a certain set of units."

    "The parameter `Npoints` is how many $V$ points are sampled over the given range. Since the simplest method of finding where $f(V)$ switches signs will only be accurate to within $\\delta V = 100\\mbox{ mV}/N_{points}$, you get a more accurate answer as `Npoints` is increased. Start with something modest like `Npoints = 100` and confirm you get something roughly close to what you found by manually looking for the equilibrium. Then increase `Npoints` until you obtain five significant figure accuracy (meaning that increasing `Npoints` any more does not affect the first five digits). You should find agreement between the two approaches."

    "With however far you got through these tasks, you should at least have a functional integrator for the ML model. There are <i>lots</i> of parameters in this model. They are mainly determined by experiment. Vary one or two and find some behavior you find interesting. Doubling things is fine, but you don't want any one parameter to become too large (i.e., 1000). Some parameters also matter more than others, so take some time to explore. You might consider making a time series $(t,V(t))$ (and/or $(t,W)$ but as separate plots) or a phase space $(V,W)$ plot to get different views of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one thing I ask is that you convince yourself (and then me) that whatever behavior you have found is <b>not</b> the result of numerical errors. For example, you might get some wild stuff if you choose your time array `t` to give you a `dt` of 3. That's probably <i>way</i> too big, and even RK4 will give garbage. One good thing to check for whatever you find is that if you double the number of time points (or cut it in half) the plot <i>looks</i> the same. This is a rough way to make sure `dt` is chosen \"small enough\" for whatever you're doing.\n",
