# A Baldur's Gate 3 Exploit Macro

Note to clear up any confusion: this directory is a collection of scripts I wrote for use when playing [Baldur's Gate 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/). This should NOT be confused with the other Games directory, which is a collection of games to play.

In Baldur's Gate 3, certain classes are granted access to spell slots. These are used as a sort of currency and allow the character to cast certain learned spells. For example, Level 1 Sorcerers are granted two first-level spell slots, meaning they can cast two first-level spells. All spell slots are only refreshed after a long rest, so as long as you consistently have enough materials to do so, you can just repeatedly long rest after running out of spell slots, right?

Well, a potential problem with this is in the highest difficulty (as of Patch 7) Honor Mode, long rests get progressively more expensive, not to mention any time sensitive quests may be affected after long resting enough times.

One of the things that makes Sorcerers unique is that they have access to what's called Sorcery Points (also refreshed after a long rest), and they can be used to activate certain class [Metamagic](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Metamagic) or create spell slots.

This macro utilizes the infinite sorcery points and spell slots [exploit](https://youtu.be/McnZwKkqanQ?si=U0h2VT1BLgwUji96) (Note: the video title is clickbait; it is SFW). This macro utilizes the second and third methods outlined in the video. I opted to use these two because Angelic Reprieve potions can be expensive in the higher difficulties and repeatedly purchasing them can add up, assuming no other party members or players want to use them. Additionally, Method 2 only requires a one-time purchase and is available earlier than the third and fourth methods, while also adhering to the choices I would most likely make in a playthrough.

It seems that the game stores the maximum number of spell slots as a number, which is inflated by the exploit. I think the reason long-resting does not work in the same manner as Angelic Reprieve potions is that long-resting also resets any party buffs and will hard reset this value to what it is supposed to be, whereas the Angelic Reprieve potions simply refill the first and second level spell slots.

Note that icon positions and subsequent mouse positions in the macro are the measurements I made, so they may not be the same for you. I recommend testing the mouse positions first with `mouse_pos.py` and adjusting the UI to your liking before running the macro. Also be sure to adjust the spell slot and sorcerer point amounts to your liking before using. This macro requires being a Sorcerer of at least level 2, and works as of Patch 7. This was designed to be used ONCE after resting. In other words, running the macro again may not work properly while already having inflated spell slots, since the macro assumes you will have no first or second level spell slots.
