# A Baldur's Gate 3 Macro

Note to clear up any confusion: this directory is a collection of scripts I wrote for use when playing [Baldur's Gate 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/). This should NOT be confused with the other Games directory, which is a collection of games to play.

In Baldur's Gate 3, certain classes are granted access to spell slots. These are used as a sort of currency and allow the character to cast certain learned spells. For example, Level 1 Sorcerers are granted two first-level spell slots, meaning they can cast two first-level spells. All spell slots are only refreshed after a long rest, so as long as you consistently have enough materials to do so, you can just repeatedly long rest after running out of spell slots, right?

Well, a potential problem with this is in the highest difficulty (as of Patch 7) Honor Mode, long rests get progressively more expensive, not to mention any time sensitive quests may be affected after long resting enough times.

One of the things that makes Sorcerers unique is that they have access to what's called Sorcery Points (also refreshed after a long rest), and they can be used to activate certain class [Metamagic](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Metamagic) or create spell slots.

This macro utilizes the infinite sorcery points and spell slots [exploit](https://youtu.be/McnZwKkqanQ?si=U0h2VT1BLgwUji96) (Note: the video title is clickbait; it is SFW). This macro utilizes the second or third methods outlined in the video. I opted to use these two because they are not as expensive as repeatedly purchasing Angelic Reprieve potions. Method 2 also only requires a one-time purchase, and is available earlier than the third and fourth methods, while also adhering to the choices I would most likely make in a playthrough.

Note that the mouse positions in the macro are the measurements I made, so they may not be the same for you. I recommend testing the mouse positions first with `mouse_pos.py` before running the macro. Also be sure to adjust the spell slot and sorcerer point amounts to your liking before using.
