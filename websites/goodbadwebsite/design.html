<h1>Good and Bad Web Design</h1>
	<p>
	In this assignment we will be looking at more examples of good and bad web design.  To see more examples of good web design, please vist
	<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/web-design-essentials-examples-and-best-practices/">Smashing Magazines examples of good design</a>
	.  You should read the pages there on best practices.  Look at the examples there and pick 5 examples from the site or anywhere else of Web sites where you like the design.
	I want you to present the pages you like and a description of a minimum of three reasons why you like them in the following format: 
	
	</p>

<h1>The Good</h1>
<h2>Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple Computers</a>
<p>
I like this site, because it is simple and balanced.  I like the fact that the designer was not afraid to use a lot of white space on the main page.  It uses a basic color palate consistently throughout the entire site.  
I like the fact that the home page has only a few links to very logical categories.  Even though there are only a few links on this 
homepage, you are only a few clicks from most things you would want to find on the site.

</p>

<h2>First Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.tesla.com">Tesla</a>
<p>I like this site because:
    <ul>
        <li>navigation at the top (including home page link) with simple structure of: product name, image, links to product</li>
        <li>not too much noise (no extraneous details), all links are related to product(s)</li>
        <li>font/color pops, unified</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Second Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://github.com">Github</a>
<p>I like this site because:
    <ul>
        <li>dark theme (easier on eyes)</li>
        <li>navigation at top, includes search bar (the page is longer than I'd like so this is nice)</li>
        <li>font/colors pop (including images), sleek
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Third Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.warpfrog.com">Warpfrog</a>
<p>I like this site because:
    <ul>
        <li>darker theme, pretty, good logo</li>
        <li>simple navigation at top of page</li>
        <li>external links for additional news/info</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Fourth Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="http://www.wolfandwood.co.uk">Wolf & Wood</a>
<p>I like this site because:
    <ul>
        <li>about section</li>
        <li>unified font, colors contrast</li>
        <li>text is centered; lots of margin space</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Fifth Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com">Nexus mods</a>
<p>I like this site because:
    <ul>
        <li>navigation at top, with search bar</li>
        <li>relatively dark, plenty of margin space</li>
        <li>neatly organized</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h1>The Bad and the Ugly</h1>
<p>For this part of the assignment, I want you to do the same thing you did for the first part, but instead
of what you like, you will be describing what you don't like.  You must include at least three reasons that the site 
you don't like has bad design.  You can find many examples of bad design on this 
<a href="https://blog.rankingbyseo.com/bad-websites/">list of the top 50 worst Web sites</a>
.</p>

<h2>First Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/web-design/best-designed-websites-2020/">an adobe site</a>
<p>I don't think this page is supposed to look like this:
    <ul>
        <li>the background image is broken?</li>
        <li>looks to be someone's very first html page</li>
        <li>very little margin space, all aligned far left</li>
        <li>no detail (fonts, other colors)</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Second Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://craigslist.org">craigslist</a>
<p>This site is bad because:
    <ul>
        <li>light mode</li>
        <li>ranging font sizes, little margin space</li>
        <li>noisy</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Third Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.art.yale.edu">yale school of art</a>
<p>This site is bad because:
    <ul>
        <li>tiled background</li>
        <li>varing box sizes and colors</li>
        <li>seemingly no structure, all left-aligned</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Fourth Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.highpoint.edu">highpoint</a>
<p>This site is objectively bad because:
    <ul>
        <li>loud, a lot of things happening</li>
        <li>varying box sizes, seemingly no unified structure</li>
        <li>light mode</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Fifth Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.usa.gov">usa.gov</a>
<p>This site is bad because:
    <ul>
        <li>too much margin space</li>
        <li>light mode, noisy</li>
        <li>text seems squished</li>
    </ul>
