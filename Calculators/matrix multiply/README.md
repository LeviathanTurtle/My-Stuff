## MATRIX MULTIPLICATION

The files in this directory contain several implementations of matrix multiplication using OpenMP, OpenMPI, and CUDA. Files leading with `s_` are serial and `p_` are parallel.

| Program Name | Serial/Parallel | Library |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------- |
| `p_matrixMult_mpi` | Parallel | OpenMPI |
| `p_matrixMult_openmp` | Parallel | OpenMP |
| `s_matrixMult_1` | Serial |
| `s_matrixMult_2` | Serial |
| `s_simpleMatrixMult` | Serial |
