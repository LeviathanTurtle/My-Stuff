Summa Theologiae Structure:
I.      God and creation
I-II.   Human being and its acts as it returns to God
II-II.  Virtues in particular
III.    Christ, sacraments, and eternal life

# Aquinas - Christology
- "Fittingness" (Convenientia)

## Incarnation
- What is it?
    - God becoming human
    - How to think about a God-man
    - Jesus Christ is one person (son of God) in 2 natures (divine and human)
    - Aquinas: Christ is viator (way-farer) and comprehensor (one who knows God's essence)
- Why? (objection / reply)
    1. God can't change / Incarnation doesn't change God, but humanity
    2. God is too God-ish (simple) / Incarnation is unfitting to flesh, but not to God due to God's goodness
    3. God taking on flesh is like God taking on malice / God takes on what comes from God's goodness but not the blame for sin
    4. God is omnipresent, so can't be limited to a small space / God's prescence and power are not spatial

    - fitting for God
    - fitting for humanity (furthers them in good and removes them from evil)
    - without sin, would there have been the Incarnation?

## Christ's manner of living
- Christ's poverty
    - fits his preaching mission 
        1. not after money
        2. frees him
    - fits symbolically
        1. "he lowered himself"
        2. God's power is manifest in human weakness

## Christ's suffering, death, and ressurection
