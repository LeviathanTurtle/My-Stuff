# Aquinas on Jesus' Suffering, Death, and Resurrection
Keep in mind: Is Aquinas closer to Anselm or Abelard?
- Why Christ's suffering?
    - necessary only as a fitting means
        - human salvation
        - christ's glorification
        - fulfill old testament promises
    - absolutely, God could have found another way
    - the most fitting means
- The Cause of Christ's suffering
    - his persecutors
    - Christ died voluntarily
- The Repayment aspect
    - what "repays" is the depth of love with which Christ faced his suffering
    - Christ is head of the "Body" the Church
- Does the Resurrection save?
    - suffering removes evil
    - resurrection advances humanity in good things
        - glorification
        - new life
        - hope of future resurrection

# William of Ockham (1285-1349)
- Franciscan friar
- Ockham's razor (theory about what it is rational to believe)
    - conceptual entities should not be multiplied unecessarily
- championing Nominalism
    - there are only singulars 
    - Empiricist epistemology
    - there are no divine ideas
    - no proofs for God work
- big on God's omnipotence and freedom
    - ethics of divine command
