# Aquinas
- Is he more Aristotelian or more Augustinian?

- Principles of Human Action
    - End (perfect happiness)
    - Will
    - Virtue (what it is, how it works; interior principle of human action)
    - Law (principle of human action, comes from outside human; exterior principle of human action)
    - Grace (exterior principle of human action)

## Aquinas on Law
- 4 types:
    1. Eternal
        - God's providence -> the ordering of things to their end in the mind of God
    2. Natural
        - human participation in eternal law, by our reason
        - Natural law precepts:
            - range from general to particular
                - General: "Good is to be done and evil is to be avoided."
                - natural inclinations:
                    - preserve life: "Don't murder innocent people."
                    - raise young: "Don't neglect to teach the young what they need to know."
                    - live in community
                    - pursue the truth
                - Particular
    3. Human
    4. Divine
        - the authority of human law is uncertain
        - human law on its own can't direct humans to an end beyond their nature
        - only divine law regulates all acts, including interior acts (i.e. motions of heart)

- "Grace does not destroy but perfects nature."
- human/divine law are distinguished from each other by being written down
    - Human: written, thought up by God
    - Divine: written, thought up by God (Commandments, revealed by God)

## Aquinas on grace
- state of integrity (before the Fall) vs. state of corruption (after the Fall)
- 2 aspects of grace:
    > God as first mover (F)
    > God's special, additional help (S)
- Can humans prepare themselves for grace? Aquinas: no

| Good that is proportional to our nature | supernatural good |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| F | F, S |
| F, S | F, S |

### Virtues
- Cardinal (prudence, justice, courage, temperance):
    - acquired: proportional to our nature
    - infused: supernatural
- Theological (charity (Greek: Agape), hope, faith)
